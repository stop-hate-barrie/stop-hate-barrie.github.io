## What is HOOK?

**Hands Off Our Kids (HOOK)** is a **Hate Group** Looking to Recruit You.
[Important Context About The "1 Million March 4 Children"][antihatecontext]

From their website:
> “Hands off our kids” is a grassroots movement dedicated to safeguarding parental rights and advocating for the removal of intrusive elements of sexual orientation and gender ideology from the educational system.

HOOK's goal is to remove education about gender and sexual orientation from the [already lacking curriculum][curr].
This is an organization that has time and again shown hatred towards the transgender community and the 2SLGBTQIA+ community as a whole. HOOK is leveraging people's lack of understanding of transgender people to push their far-right agenda. [The key organizer](#about-the-founder-of-hook) is nationalistic, transphobic, homophibic and anti-semetic conspiracy theorist who's ultimate goal is the irradication of not just transgender people, but several other groups as well.


Below are more resources that expose HOOK for what it really is.

## About the Key Organizer of HOOK
In his most recent Tiktok video (as of August 26th) El-Cheikh celebrates getting on air with white nationalist [Stew Peters](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stew_Peters%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1725745922544592%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1NMkrRF2i-JL52iixTf7K4&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1725745922570157&usg=AOvVaw0WTFspgFJRLL7eJznylxL4). 

It inherently ties Israeli apartheid/genocide in Palestine with Jewish world domination  i.e. “the satanic Jews control the world just as Israel controls the United States” and strongly implies “the Jews” are also responsible for “gender ideology in our schools” and “the woke.” 

Interestingly, El-Cheikh is simultaneously doing interviews where he claims to “love all religions, even Jews” with Canadian alti-right youtubers. He seems to play to any audience that will have him.
