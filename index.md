## About HOOK

**Hands Off Our Kids (HOOK)** is a **Hate Group** dedicated to removing all educational content about 2SLGBTQIA+ people from an [already lacking school curriculum][curr].

**HOOK** operates under the guise of a non-profit organization "safeguarding children’s rights" while actively platforming [hate speech at rallies][hateondisplay]. They [create and circulate content demonizing 2SLGBTQIA+ people as a threat to children.][united]


### About the 1 Million March 4 Children

HOOK is once again behind the [1 Million March 4 Children][arrests] demonstrations planned at legislatures, city halls, and school board offices across the country on September 20th. These demonstrations seek to [eliminate Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity][antihatecontext] (SOGI) curriculum and policies from Canadian schools. They build on the rhetoric of US right-wing extremist organizations and the anti-gay crusaders who came before them to [recruit unsuspecting parents][parentgroomers].

### About The Organizers
Despite ongoing claims that **HOOK** "welcomes individuals from all faiths, nationalities, and cultural backgrounds", founder Kamel El-Cheikh has promoted his movement on predominantly far-right channels, including *Krayden's Right*, the *Alex Saz Show*, *Clyde Do Something*, *LifeSiteNews* (LSN) and *Laura-Lynn.tv*. On August 26th, 2024, he celebrated going on air with **white supremacist conspiracy theorist** Stew Peters of the eponymous [*Stew Peters Network*][stew].

**(Note: We have avoided providing direct links to the channels of influencers and news pundits mentioned in this section because they produce a significant volume of content promoting hatred towards marginalized groups. Please keep this in mind when doing your own research.)**
